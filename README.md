# Blinkit Retail Performance & Revenue Analytics Dashboard
End-to-end business intelligence case study analyzing retail revenue performance, outlet segmentation, product category contribution, and regional sales trends. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify growth drivers, operational gaps, and data-driven expansion opportunities.

## Project Background

Blinkit is a quick-commerce grocery delivery platform operating across multiple outlet formats and city tiers. As competition intensifies in the online grocery space, leadership requires structured visibility into revenue performance, outlet efficiency, and product contribution.

This project transforms item-level retail sales data into a strategic, decision-ready business intelligence case study designed for non-technical stakeholders.

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

- Identify key revenue drivers across product categories  
- Evaluate outlet performance by size and location tier  
- Assess sales distribution patterns across city segments  
- Highlight operational strengths and potential expansion opportunities  

The outcome is an executive-focused dashboard that converts raw transactional data into actionable commercial insights.
